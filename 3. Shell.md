## The Shell 
The Unix shell provides a user interface. “The most basic UNIX shell provides a 'command line' which allows you to type in commands which are translated by the shell into kernel speak and sent off to the kernel.” 

```bash
$ cat /etc/shells
```
```
sh: Bourne shell
csh: C-shell
tcsh: C-shell enhanced with file name completion and command line editing.
ksh: Korn shell
bash: Bourne again shell
zsh: Z shell (oh my zsh)
```

BASH "Bourne Again SHell"
It was a replament for the Bourne Shell.
Shell scripting is scripting in any shell.
BASH scripting is scripting for BASH.

When you launch a terminal you get a terminal emulator window with bash running inside of it, generally by default.

Default shell for most linux, MacOS, WSL and solaris
