## Check for existing keys
Linux
```bash
$ ls -la ~/.ssh
```
Windows
```cmd
C:\> dir ~/.ssh
```
Lists the files in your `~/.ssh` directory. If you have already created a key previously you see two files.
```
-rw-------   1 toby  staff  1766 11 Jan  2014 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--   1 toby  staff   413 11 Jan  2014 id_rsa.pub
```
`id_rsa` is the private key, keep this very private this the key to your kingdom.

`id_rsa.pub` is your public key, this you give other people and services

Generate a new ssh key
```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- The default name is `id_rsa`
- Always create a passphrase

```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC..eafddPMr7Rd3UIHIg7DBRetn5k7TRdCMH3CioD6ZyNDytmpC85xQPtL...UR77nrQ== your_email@example.com
```

```bash
$ ssh 127.0.0.1
```
Will ssh to 127.0.0.1 using the default key `id_rsa` using the current username

```bash
$ ssh username@127.0.0.1 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Working with ssh-agent
 
 "Single Sign-On using SSH. The ssh-agent is a helper program that keeps track of user's identity keys and their passphrases. The agent can then use the keys to log into other servers without having the user type in a password or passphrase again."

Starting the ssh-agent on linux
```
$ eval `ssh-agent`
```

List keys keys accessible to the agent
```bash
$ ssh-add -l
```

Add default key to the agent
```bash
$ ssh-add 
```
Add specific key to the agent
```bash
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/my-other-key
```

Windows 10 april ssh is install by default.

##Â SSH config

`~/.ssh/config` helps you use different identities for different services.

```bash
$ ssh github.com -i ~/.ssh/github.brighter.key
```

`~/.ssh/config`
```
Host github-brighter
    User toby
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.brighter.key
Host github-org
    User tobias
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.key
Host 10.10.1.0
    User testuser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/testuser.key
Host *
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

# SSH authorized keys

`/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys` file is the public keys that can be used to log in to the account.

Create a user that can, ssh using key, with no password and sudo abilities
```
sudo useradd -m user --groups sudo
sudo mkdir -p /home/user/.ssh
sudo touch /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo vim /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys

cat /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown -R user:user /home/user/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/user/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo touch /etc/sudoers.d/prognet
sudo vim /etc/sudoers.d/prognet
user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
cat /etc/sudoers.d/prognet
````
